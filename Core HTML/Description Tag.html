    <p><b><i>What is Tech Stack?</b></i></p>
    <p>A tech stack, or a software stack, is a collection of software tools, frameworks, programming languages, and
        libraries used to build a software application. <br>A tech stack consists of two equally important elements:
        <br>the frontend (client-side) and <br>backend (server-side).<br> Both work together to create a working tech
        stack. This is also referred to as an application stack.
    </p>
    <p>Client side that consist of what the user sees and interacts with frontend technologies includes html, css,
        javascript and UI frameworks and libraries.</p>
    <p>Server side which is also know as backend that runs behind the application and its feature . barious Backend

                <dt><b>The MERN Stack</b> </dt>
                <dd>The MERN stack is one of the most popular stacks currently used in web development. It's composed
                    of<b><i>
                            MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js</i></b>. There are various stacks that are similar
                    in
                    composition to the MERN stack, including the MEAN and MEVN stacks (see below). While these other
                    stacks
                    are
                    popular options, usage of the MERN stack has surged in recent years thanks to one<mark> key feature:
                        React</mark>.

                    React is the most popular library in the world. The popularity of React is mostly due to <u>its
                        ability
                        to
                        simplify the creation and management of an application’s user interface (UI) and improve overall
                        site
                        performance</u>. It has also benefited from the support of its creator, Facebook, and an
                    enthusiastic
                    community of users.

                    When you put React together with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, the result is a JavaScript-based
                    tech
                    stack that’s highly customizable, developer-friendly, and cost-effective, as it’s completely
                    open-source.
                    The MERN stack works especially well with social media platforms, news aggregation applications, and
                    workflow management. It’s currently being used by several prominent companies, including Netflix and
                    Uber.

                <dt><b>The MEAN Stack</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The MEAN stack is similar to the MERN stack, except that instead of using React, it relies on<mark>
                        Angular</mark> instead.It's composed of<b><i>
                            MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js</i></b>. Angular is a popular front end framework
                    used
                    to
                    simplify the development and testing process. <u>Created by programmers at Google, Angular is
                        considered
                        an
                        all-in-one framework because it addresses a variety of the complications developers encounter
                        when
                        building single-page applications (SPA)</u>.

                    The MEAN stack has been a popular choice among Web Developers for years. Its success can largely be
                    attributed to the fact that the four technologies—MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js—work
                    exceptionally well together. Like the MERN stack, MEAN includes Node.js, which allows the usage of
                    JavaScript on the back end. That means developers don’t need to know Python, Ruby, or PHP—only
                    JavaScript—in
                    order to use the MEAN stack. All of the underlying technologies in the MEAN stack are open source,
                    which
                    allows developers to create robust apps quickly and inexpensively.

                <dd>
                    The MEVN stack will likely look familiar; it contains all the elements of the two prior stacks but
                    with
                    one
                    exception—it uses <mark>Vue.js</mark> on the front end instead of relying on React or Angular.It's
                    composed
                    of<b><i>
                            MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js</i></b>. Created by a programmer at Google as a
                    lightweight
                    alternative to Angular, Vue.js is a front end framework that’s prized for its simplicity and
                    adaptability.
                    <u>Vue is often called a “progressive” framework because developers can easily add components and
                        adapt
                        the
                        framework to meet their needs.</u>

                    While there are many similarities between the MEVN stack and the MERN and MEAN stacks, there are a
                    few
                    reasons why developers would choose Vue.js over the other options. For starters,<u> Vue.js has an
                        incrementally adoptable design that allows for easy customization and integration with various
                        frameworks and libraries; this level of customization and flexibility is one of the reasons
                        Vue.js
                        has
                        become a popular choice among Web Developers. They also like that it’s powerful, lightweight,
                        easy
                        to
                        learn, and offers a variety of features.</u>

                <dt><b>The Serverless Stack</b></dt>
                <dd>
                    The serverless stack is a unique entry on this list because, unlike the other stacks, it
                    <mark>doesn’t
                        depend upon a local server; it relies on cloud infrastructure instead</mark>. Serverless stacks
                    have
                    surged in popularity in recent years for several reasons. For one,<u> developers are able to write
                        and
                        execute code without worrying about building the infrastructure; using a serverless stack
                        simplifies
                        infrastructure management because the cloud platform is responsible for maintaining the server
                        and
                        conducting all the necessary security updates.</u> Since there are fewer things to worry about
                    on
                    the
                    back end, this frees developers up to focus more time and attention on client-side elements and
                    improve
                    user
                    experience.

                    Another advantage of the serverless stack is it <u>offers a high level of scalability—it can adapt
                        quickly,
                        even if user numbers fluctuate wildly. And because developers are only charged for the space
                        they
                        use on
                        the server</u>, it’s also a cost-effective solution. When selecting a serverless solution, there
                    are
                    several options for developers to choose from; the most widely used serverless platform providers
                    include

                <dd>
                    The LAMP stack is composed of <b><i>Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP</i></b>. Considered one of the
                    best
                    ways
                    to build web applications, LAMP is a classic stack that’s been a favorite of developers for more
                    than 20
                    years. The LAMP stack was one of the <u>first open-source stacks ever made available worldwide and
                        it
                        has
                        remained popular for decades thanks to its reputation for simplicity and stability</u>.

                    The LAMP stack has long been considered an essential web development tool and has been used on
                    well-known
                    platforms like <mark>Shopify and WordPress</mark>. The stack is a favorite among Web Developers
                    because
                    it’s
                    a cost-effective and customizable solution that allows them to develop extensible, high-performance
                    websites
                    and applications. <u>The LAMP stack also runs efficiently on any operating system and easily handles
                        dynamic
                        pages, which allows developers to add new content without worry</u>. Overall, <u><i>LAMP is an

                    The PERN stack is almost exactly the same as the MERN stack but with one big difference: <b><i>the
                            PERN
                            stack uses PostgreSQL database instead of MongoDB</b></i>. <u>Postgre is a dependable,
                        secure,
                        enterprise-grade SQL-based database system that emphasizes extensibility and compliance</u>. It
                    was
                    first created in 1996 at the University of California in Berkeley and has enjoyed immense popularity
                    ever
                    since. In fact, it’s currently ranked as the <u>second most popular database according to Stack
                        Overflow’s
                        2021 survey of Web Developers</u>.

                    So what makes developers choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB? There are a few reasons. For starters,
                    <u>PostgreSQL has strict rules for data integrity and is<mark> ACID (atomicity, consistency,
                            isolation,
                            and
                            durability) compliant, which guarantees data validity. It also follows monolithic
                            architecture</mark>
                        so
                        the
                        components are united and work together systematically plus it offers multiple fail-safes that
                        make
                        storage more reliable. It’s attributes like these that make PostgreSQL the favored choice among
                        healthcare and banking companies. And unlike MongoDB, Postgre uses traditional SQL syntax and
                        format,
                        storing data in tabular format in rows and columns instead of as documents, which allows for
                        more
                        complex inquiries. Postgre also scales more easily than NoSQL databases so it’s a good match for
                        large
                        enterprises.</u>

                    This stack is centered on Ruby on Rails, a popular Ruby-based framework. The Ruby on Rails stack
                    allows

                    Ruby
                    on Rails, which allows developers to easily customize the applications they’re creating.
