        <p>Meghalaya was formed on 21 January 1972 by carving out two districts from the state of Assam: (a) the United
            Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills and (b) the Garo Hills.The population of Meghalaya as of 2014 is estimated to
            be
            3,211,474.Meghalaya covers an area of approximately 22,429 square kilometres, with a length-to-breadth ratio
            of
            about 3:1. <br>

            The state is bound to the south by the Bangladeshi divisions of Mymensingh and Sylhet, to the west by the
            Bangladeshi division of Rangpur, and to the north and east by India's State of Assam. The capital of
            Meghalaya
            is Shillong. During the British rule of India, the British imperial authorities nicknamed it the "Scotland
            of
            the East".English is the official language of Meghalaya. Unlike many Indian states, Meghalaya has
            historically
            followed a matrilineal system where the lineage and inheritance are traced through women; the youngest
            daughter
            inherits all wealth and she also takes care of her parents.
            Meghalaya has predominantly an agrarian economy with a significant commercial forestry industry. The
            important crops are potatoes, rice, maize, pineapples, bananas, papayas, and spices. The service sector is
            made up of real estate and insurance companies. Meghalaya's gross state domestic product for 2012 was
            estimated at â‚¹16,173 crore (US$2.0 billion) in current prices.</p>
