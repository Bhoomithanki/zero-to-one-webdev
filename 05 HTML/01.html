    <h1>What's SEO ?</h1>
    <p>SEO stands for <u><mark>Search Engine Optimization.</mark></u> <br>
        Engine means Interpreater or compiler while optimization means the process of modifying a system to make some
        features of it work more efficiently .
        <br>It's the <mark> process of improving your website to increase its visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing, and
            other
            search engines </mark>. <br>In HTML comman way to help Search Engine is to use the following :
    <ul>
        <li> <mark>Use Title Tag</mark></li>
        <p> One of the <u>most important HTML tags for SEO</u> is that of the title. This is the label of your content
            and how searches see your page in Google and Bing. <u>Every result you see in a search engine is derived
                from the title tag</u>.</p>
        <li><mark>Meta Tags</mark></li>
        <p>Another vital HTML tag for SEO is the<u> meta description</u>. Like titles, this information shows in search
            results of Google. Take a look under the link for any search. It's <u>best if you use your keyword in the
                title as well as the meta description tag. It improves how search engines list your content</u>.</p>
        <li><mark>Header Tags</mark></li>
        <p>Header tags are often <u>used to break up the content to make it easier to read</u>.Headers make it
            <u>easier</u> for these people to <u>find what they’re looking for quickly</u>.The h1 to h6 behave as
            following for SEO : <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                h1 - usually reserved for webpage titles.
            </li>
            <li>
                h2 - highlights the topic of the title.
            </li>
            <li>
                h3 - reflects points in regards to the topic.
            </li>
            <li>
                h4 -supports points from h3.
            </li>
            <li>h5 – not often used, but great for supporting points of h4.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <li><mark>Alt Tags</mark></li>
        <p>Unfortunately, <u>search engines cannot determine what images are trying to convey. </u> <br> That’s when the
            ALT tag comes into play.This <u>tag tells web browsers what image to show in the content</u>. the alt
            attribute of this tag <u>tells search engines the picture is about</u>.And this could
            reduce exposure during image searches.</p>
        <li> <mark>Language Meta Tags</mark></li>
        <p>language meta stage which <u>tells search engines the language of the page</u>.</p>
    </ul>
    </p>
