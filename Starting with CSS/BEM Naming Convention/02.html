        <p>
            The BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention is a method of organizing and struct
            uring CSS classes to make it easier for developers to understand and maintain their codebases. It
            helps in creating reusable stylesheets by assigning specific meanings to each class so that they
            can be easily identified and manipulated as needed. In this article, we will explore how to
            implement the BEM naming convention in your HTML/CSS files.

        According to the BEM convention, every element on a webpage should be broken down into three parts
        - block, element, modifier names to construct CSS names and are separated by double underscores (__) and hyphens
        (-).Each block consists of elements and modifiers that can be used to create variations of that block. This
        approach makes it easy to understand the purpose of each class and how they relate to each other.

        Blocks: A block represents the highest-level abstraction of the component. It is represented by a single word
        and represents a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. For example, a button, a form, a header, etc.
        Elements: An element represents a part of the block. It is represented by the block name followed by two
        underscores (__) and the element name. For example, if the block name is ‘button’, the element name can be
        ‘label’ or ‘icon’.
        Modifiers: A modifier represents a variation of the block or element. It is represented by the block or element
        name followed by a single hyphen (-) and the modifier name. A modifier can be used to change the appearance or
        behavior of a block or element. For example, a button can have different variations like ‘primary’, ‘secondary’,
        ‘disabled’ etc.
